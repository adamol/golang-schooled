# Student Management System

A system for teachers to
- keep of track their classes
- make notes of students from each class
- insert grades for students
- view a students / class progress over a year
- upload material for the students

potentially there could also be a section for the students
however this might perhaps warrent a separate service?
students could then be able to
- see uploaded material from class (lecture notes, homework etc)

# Features

- an administrator sets up the accounts for the teachers
- the students can themselves register and "add" their courses
