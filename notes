Teachers can:
    - create courses
        + add students to courses
        + add lectures to courses
            - add material / notes to lectures
            - add tests and grade tests                             <-- maybe?
    - view the schedule for other teachers and which courses they have

Students can:
    - view available courses
        - can view course information from previous year
    - see some calenderesque view of their lectures
    - see course overview with all the lectures
    - view a specific lecture and see notes/material/description
    - receive grades on tests and can view their progress           <-- maybe?
    - leave feedback for courses?

# Todo
    - implement database layer (mysql?)
    - implement GET courses and GET courses/{id}
    - separate to MVC structure
