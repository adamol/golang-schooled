# Student Management System

Teachers can:
    - create courses
        + add students to courses
        + add lectures to courses
            - add material / notes to lectures
            - add tests and grade tests                             <-- maybe?
    - view the schedule for other teachers and which courses they have

Students can:
    - view available courses and add theirs
    - see some calenderesque view of their lectures
    - see course overview with all the lectures
    - view a specific lecture and see notes/material/description
    - receive grades on tests and can view their progress           <-- maybe?
